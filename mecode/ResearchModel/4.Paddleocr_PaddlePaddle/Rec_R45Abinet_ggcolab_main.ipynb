These parameters are what the model has learned during training and are crucial for making predictions. This file is usually larger than the `.pdmodel` file as it contains the actual numerical values that define the behavior of the model.\n","\n","3. **`inference.pdiparams.info`**: This file typically contains additional metadata about the parameters, such as information required for the initialization of parameters during model loading. It can include data shapes, types, and other relevant details necessary for correctly interpreting the parameters in the `.pdiparams` file.\n","\n","When deploying a PaddlePaddle model for inference, all three files are required. The `.pdmodel` file provides the framework with the structure of the model, while the `.pdiparams` file provides the specific weights that the model uses to make predictions.
